        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            This is my first quarter at the Unviersity of Washington. I remember last year at my   <br>
            community college, all I cared about was getting accepted into their Computer Science  <br>
            program as a transfer student, it feels so surreal to be here! If I had to set a theme <br>
            for this quarter, it would be discovery.

    <div class="text">
        This is my first quarter at the University of Washington! I remember last year at my
        community college, all I cared about was getting accepted into their Computer Science
        program as a transfer student, and it feels so surreal to be here! If I had to set a theme
        for this quarter, it would be discovery.
    </div><br><br>

    <div class="title">Academic interest</div>
    <div class="text">
        Honestly, walking into this quarter, I thought I was going to be a full-fledged theory
        enthusiast that hated programming. Last year, while I was planning out my course schedule
        for UW, I remember trying to include as many theory courses as possible, and hating on any
        course that had programming in it. In fact, I was even planning on going to graduate school
        for CS or math theory. If you asked me last year what I thought about HTML/CSS/JavaScript, I probably
        would've told you I thought they were a waste of time to learn. But looking back on things, BOY I WAS WRONG.
        <br><br>
        I LOVE making things in HTML/CSS! Ever since I attended an "Intro to HTML" workshop ran by an RSO called "Web
        Impact," I've been spending my time trying to learn as much as possible about web development through treating
        my personal website as a long-term project. If you saw the first draft of my website, you'd know it was rough. I
        just enjoy seeing things I program come to real life.
        <br><br>
        And with regards to theory, it's just not something for me. Although I occasionally bump into ideas that I think
        are cool, I'm more attracted to the aspect of CS where I'm building things in the real world for others to use.
        This quarter, I'm taking 1 theory class (CSE 311) and 1 "programming" class (CSE 351) (in quotes because it's
        a low-level programming class in C not really applicable to industry), and I've been enjoying CSE 351 way more
        DESPITE not being a real programming class.

    <div class="title">No more math</div>
    <div class="text">
        Personally, unless you REALLY enjoy math, and want to do CS theory, I think double majoring in math and CS
        is a waste of time if your end goal is to become a SWE. Being at UW has showed me the importance of spending
        my time wisely. The biggest benefit of attending a huge school like UW is it's immense ammount of opportunitites,
        but with this comes the responsibility of making decisions intentionally on which opportunities you want
        to take advantage of, since you can't do them all.
        <br><br>
        And with my time here so far, I'm happy I realized this sooner rather than later. This quarter, it's been really
        difficult for me to juggle 14 STEM credits, grinding LeetCode, applying to internships, working on personal
        projects, being involved in clubs, and having a healthy sleep schedule/ social life. In fact, I don't grind
        LeetCode, and I never have time to work on personal projects. In the future, because I'm dropping the math
        double major, I'll now be able to spend more time doing things more applicable to what I actually want to do in
        the future, which is to build things in the real world for others to use.
        <br><br>
        No hate to the math double majors. In fact, I think you guys are really cool. But for now, I'm focused on becoming
        a SWE.

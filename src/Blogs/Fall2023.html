        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            This is my first quarter at the Unviersity of Washington! I remember last year at my 
            community college, all I cared about was getting accepted into their Computer Science 
            program as a transfer student, it feels so surreal to be here! If I had to set a theme 
            for this quarter, it would be discovery.
        </p>

        <h2>CS Classes</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly, walking into this quarter, I thought I was going to be a full-fledged theory 
            enthusiast that hated programming. Last year, while I was planning out my course schedule 
            for UW, I remember trying to include as many theory courses as possible, and hating on any 
            course that had programming in it. But looking back after my first week here, BOY I WAS WRONG. 
            In CSE 311, my first introduction to CS theory class, everything just feels so slow and 
            uninteresting to me. Honeslty, I'll give it another week. Maybe it's because it's only been the 
            first week lol, we'll see how it turns out.
        </p>
        <p>
            While CSE 311 is making me doubt how enjoyable I find theory, UW opened my eyes up to the beauty of 
            programming through my first low-level programming course, CSE 351! In CSE 351, you start to develop 
            a conceptual understanding of how everything in a computer is just a file, and everything in that 
            file is just composed of 1's and 0's stored inside adresses that take up a computers entire memory. 
            Basically, everything in a computer is made up of 1's and 0's.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would say CSE 351 is a hybrid engineering/programming course. I've learned the basics behind how 
            hardware and software are able to communicate with each other, how bits and bytes are actually stored 
            inside of a computer, and a few basics on C programming. The class even taught me how to use a Linux 
            operating system, and made me feel like a Linux god during Lab0 not gonna lie, but overall, there's not 
            enough programming in the course for me to call it a pure programming class. If I wanted to get into C 
            programming, that means I would need to take CSE 333 (Systems Programming), a class I DEFINITELY now 
            plan on taking after CSE 351 has gotten me hooked into programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the few coding prompts in CSE 351 have already convinced me that programming is for me, imagine how 
            much more enjoyable I'll find the real programming classes at UW (such as 332, 331, and 403). 
            I know it's only been a week, but sometimes while I'm walking around campus, I take a step 
            back from the grind mindset, and look around and feel incredibly grateful for being able to attend such 
            a great institution that's given me the opportunity to explore and find what I care about. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess the only thing I can say is this, skipping the gym before my finals at my community college was 
            worth it :)
        </p>

        <h2>Math Classes</h2>
        <p>
            I'm taking Probability, and it's been WICKED. Homework and lecture consists of solving riddles. The concepts you 
            learn are really cool, and I would say this has been the most applicable class I've taken to the real world. When I'm 
            going through my NPC activities, in my head I would think of 3/4-letter words, and rearrange their letters to see the 
            possible ways I can use them to form new words. An example of this would be the word "cat". I'd think: cat, cta, 
            act, atc, tac, tca. I did it whenever I needed to fill up my mind, AND NOW I'M DOING IT FOR HOMEWORK. I can't wait 
            to take more probability courses, and using the math I've learned one day to hopefully make a positive change in the world, 
            and maybe win some casino games :).
            <br><br>
            I'm ashamed to admit this, but I used to be enrolled in Math 334, the start of the accelerated advanced calculus sequence at UW, 
            but I decided to not pursue it 3 weeks before class started, and I feel incredibly disappointed in myself. At the time, I thought 
            I was making the right decision, because I didn't see myself going to graduate school for math, and I thought it would be a 
            waste of time, but as I'm sitting next to a guy taking Math 334 in my CSE 311 lecture, and I'm eavesdropping over his homework, 
            I sometimes ask myself, "Would I still have been able to handle it?" "Would've it made me fallen in love with math?" "Am I 
            not staying true to myself?"
            <br><br>
            It's because, even though Probability is a cool subject in general, the class doesn't give me the intellecutal stimuli 
            in math that enjoyed so much at my comminity college. There aren't any problems I sleep over and think to myself, "Hmm, 
            how else could I solve this?"
            <br><br>
            I feel like I wasted a great opportunity. Not only the opportunity to test myself, but the opportunity to be in a room with 
            other fellow math enthusiasts. This was my only chance to take the sequence for it to have a significant impact in my 
            academic trajectory. If I take it next year, I'd be a Junior, and at that point I might as well be taking the 40X and 42X sequence. 
            Well, there's nothing I can really do now. I need to move on, and make a new game plan.
            <br><br>
            Here's what I view as the solution: Finish MATH 300 and MATH 327 by the end of this year, so by next year I'll have the same 
            prereqs satisfied as the MATH 33X group this year. And if I really like MATH 327, then I'll be taking the analysis series.

        <h2>Dabble</h2>
        <p>
            October 10, 2023 <br>
            I think I just witnessed history. It was a cloudy day at 8 PM in the CSE2 building at UW. I was grinding out my 
            CSE 351 lab due next week in one of the whiteboard rooms, until I saw a recognizable face.
            <br><br>
            THE CEO OF DABBLE WALKED UP TO ME AND ASKED IF HE COULD USE THE ROOM! As a preface, Dabble is a startup at UW
            working on creating a centralized social media platform. I knew about them mosty through LinkedIn stalking, and
            just thought to myself, "Dang, these people are cool."
            <br><br>
            Here's how the conversation went: <br>
            "Hey, can we use this room." <br>
            "Do I need to leave?" <br>
            "There's like 7 of us" <br>
            "Are you guys working on Dabble?" <br>
            "Yes. Have I talked to you about it before?" <br>
            "No, I know you guys through LinkedIn" <br>
            "That's cool, please stay and I'll bring the team in" <br>
            * team comes inside *
            "This guy knows Dabble. So what do we do?" <br>
            "You guys are creating a centralized social media platform" <br>
            "oh shit he does know us" <br>
             <br>
            And then I sat in on their meeting for like 40 minutes, doing nothing but staring at my homework feeling starstruck
            and impressed at the same time. It takes a lot of hard work to build something on your own from the ground up, and
            I hope one day to follow their footsteps.
             <br> <br>
            What would've you done in that situation? Honestly, I just awkwardly sat there like a stalker. While I was leaving, 
            the CEO asked for my Instagram and I gave it to him. Maybe I'll contact him and try to become involved.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>
            I WON A 12K SCHOLARSHIP! I had my interview like 5 days after I moved in, and I think I really 
            hit it off with the committee.
            <br><br>
            Also, ever since I moved into UW, I've been starting to function much more efficiently and 
            normally. For example, back then, I use to have a really hard time sleeping. Like no matter what 
            I'd do, whether it be melatonin, counting to 100, or exercising before bed, I could never get my 
            body to naturally sleep at a healthy range. But now, I no longer need to do those things, and my 
            body just goes to sleep during normal times (10 PM - 11 PM). I just lay in bed, close my eyes, and 
            then I fall asleep. I can't believe I was missing out on this for the last 19 years of my life.

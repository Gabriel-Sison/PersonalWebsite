        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            This is my first quarter at the Unviersity of Washington. I remember last year at my   <br>
            community college, all I cared about was getting accepted into their Computer Science  <br>
            program as a transfer student, it feels so surreal to be here! If I had to set a theme <br>
            for this quarter, it would be discovery.
        </p>

        <h2>CS Classes</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly, walking into this quarter, I thought I was going to be a full-fledged theory <br>
            enthusiast that hated programming. Last year while I was planning out my course schedule<br>
            for UW, I remember trying to include as many theory courses as possible, and hating on any<br>
            course that had programming in it. But looking back after my first week here, BOY WAS I WRONG.<br>
            In CSE 311, my first introduction to CS theory class, everything just feels so slow and <br>
            uninteresting to me. The idea of theory use to intrigue me, but when you practice it in real<br>
            life, it's just not something I enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. In fact, I have a tremendous amount of<br>
            respect and admiration towards mathematicians that have helped derive formulas used in our<br>
            everyday lives. But UW made me realize that DOING theory work isn't for me, and this<br>
            realization was further brought home while taking CSE 351, my first low-level programming<br>
            class in C!
        </p>
        <p>
            In CSE 351, you start to develop a conceptual understanding of how everything in a computer is<br>
            just a file, and everything in that file is just composed of 1's and 0's stored inside adresses <br>
            that take up a computers entire memory. Basically, everything in a computer is made up of 1's and<br>
            0's!
        </p>
        <p>
            I would say CSE 351 is a hybrid engineering/programming course. I've learned the basics behind how<br>
            hardware and software are able to communicate with each other, how bits and bytes are actually stored<br>
            inside of a computer, and a few basics on C programming. The class even taught me how to use a Linux<br>
            operating system, and made me feel like a Linux god during Lab0 not gonna lie, but overall, there's not<br>
            enough programming in the course for me to call it a pure programming class. If I wanted to get into C <br>
            programming, that means I would need to take CSE 333 (Systems Programming), a class I DEFINITELY now<br>
            plan on taking after CSE 351 has gotten me hooked into programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the few coding prompts in CSE 351 have already convinced me that programming is for me, imagine how<br>
            much more enjoyable I'll find the real programming classes at UW will be (such as 332, 331, and 403).<br>
            I know it's only been a week, but sometimes while I'm walking on the UW campus, I sometimes take a step<br>
            back from the grind mindset, and look around and feel incredibly grateful for being able to attend such<br>
            a great institution that's given me the freedom to explore and find what I care about. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess the only thing I can say is this, skipping the gym before my finals at my community college was <br>
            worth it :)
        </p>

        <h2>Math Classes</h2>
        <p>
            I'm taking Probability, and it's been okay.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Dorming</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly, my biggest concern when I first started dorming was how I was going to continue my<br>
            gym bro lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>
            I WON A 12K SCHOLARSHIP! I had my interview like 5 days after I moved in, and I think I really<br>
            hit it off with the committee.
            <br><br>
            Also, ever since I moved into UW, I've been starting to function much more efficiently and <br>
            normally. For example, back then, I use to have a really hard time sleeping. Like no matter what <br>
            I'd do, whether it be melatonin, counting to 100, or exercising before bed, I could never get my<br>
            body to naturally sleep at a healthy range. But now, I no longer need to do those things, and my <br>
            body just goes to sleep during normal times (10 PM - 11 PM). I just lay in bed, close my eyes, and <br>
            then I fall asleep. I can't believe I was missing out on this for the last 19 years of my life.<br>
